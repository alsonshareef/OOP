// Trying to understand OOP.

/*

DEFINITION:
Objected-Oriented Programming is an approach to programming, or a programming paradigm that revolves around organising your data and functionality through objects and their methods. This assigns certain types of information to its own singular object; keeping any relevant information in one place which removes clashing code and keeps things organized. Any kind of functionality that is associated to a particular type of information will be stored in its relevant object as a 'method'.
